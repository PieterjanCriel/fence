    "# 🤺 Demo: Agents and MCP Servers\n",
    "\n",
    "## Demo overview\n",
    "In this demo notebook, we will explore how to create and interact with an MCP server using the `mcp` Python package and `fence-llm`. \n",
    "- First section; Setup a simple Local MCP server (via the `Agent` class and the `BedrockAgent` class)\n",
    "- Second section; Interact with a third-party MCP server\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Context Protocal\n",
    "\n",
    "The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard introduced by Anthropic in November 2024 to streamline the integration of AI models, particularly large language models (LLMs), with external tools, systems, and data sources. Often likened to the “USB-C for AI apps,” MCP provides a universal interface that allows AI assistants to interact with various software components in a consistent manner .\n",
    "\n",
    "An MCP server acts as a bridge between AI agents and external functionalities. It exposes tools, enabling AI models to perform actions like reading files, querying databases, or invoking APIs without the need for custom integrations. This modular approach promotes interoperability and simplifies the development of AI-driven applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Transport options\n",
    "Transport Options for MCP Servers\n",
    "\n",
    "MCP supports multiple transport mechanisms to accommodate different deployment scenarios:\n",
    "- __Standard Input/Output (stdio)__: Ideal for local development and testing, stdio allows MCP servers to communicate through the standard input and output streams. This method is straightforward to implement and is well-suited for environments where simplicity and ease of setup are priorities .\n",
    "- __Server-Sent Events (SSE)__: SSE enables unidirectional, real-time communication from the server to the client over HTTP. It’s useful for scenarios where the server needs to push updates to the client without requiring complex bidirectional protocols. However, as of March 2025, SSE has been deprecated in favor of more robust solutions . ￼\n",
    "- __HTTP Stream Transport__: This modern transport mechanism supports bidirectional communication and streaming over HTTP, providing a more flexible and scalable solution for web-based MCP applications. It allows for advanced features like session management and comprehensive authentication options .\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note** This notebook assumes you have access to AWS Bedrock, as we use Bedrock's Claude-instant model to fuel our LLM interactions."
