    "### ü§î What is the environment?\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating an agent, it is possible to pass an environment dictionary to the agent. This environment dictionary can be used to store information that is relevant to the agent, but not part of the model or tools. This information can be accessed by the agent and its delegates and tools during execution. This allows for the agent to be called with a specific set of hardcoded values that are scoped to that agent, e.g. a customer ID, a user ID, or a specific configuration. \n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚öôÔ∏è How does it work?\n",
    "\n",
    "The environment is passed to the agent when it is created. The agent can then access the environment using the `self.environment` attribute. The environment is a dictionary, so it can store any type of data that is relevant to the agent. The agent, by default, passes this environment to its tools when they are executed. This allows the tools to access the environment as well.\n",
