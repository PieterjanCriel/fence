    "This notebook demonstrates the use of various classes in this package. The core intent of this package is to provide a framework for interacting with language models in a way that is modular, extensible, and easy to use. The core classes are:\n",
    "- `PromptTemplate`: A template for a prompt that can be rendered with a dictionary of variables (or using keywords). It wraps around jinja2.Template, but adds some additional functionality.\n",
    "- `LLM`: A wrapper around a language model. \n",
    "- `Link`: Atomic LLM interaction wrapper. Takes in a PromptTemplate and a language model. It can be invoked with a dictionary of variables, and will return a dictionary of variables.\n",
    "- `TransformationLink`: A wrapper around a `function` that takes a dictionary of variables and returns a dictionary of variables. It can be invoked with a dictionary of variables, and will return a dictionary of variables.\n",
    "- `Chain`: A collection of links that are invoked in the right order based on the input and output keys for each Link.\n",
    "- `LinearChain`: A sequence of links that are invoked in the order they are passed in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through these classes, we can interact with LLMs in varying degrees of complexity:\n",
    "1. Just call the model directly\n",
    "2. Use a `PromptTemplate` for reusability and abstraction\n",
    "3. Use a `Link` for atomic LLM interaction\n",
    "4. Use a `Chain` to execute a collection of `Links`\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we'll go through each of these levels of complexity and provide examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note** This notebook assumes you have access to AWS Bedrock, as we use Bedrock's Claude-instant model to fuel our LLM interactions."
