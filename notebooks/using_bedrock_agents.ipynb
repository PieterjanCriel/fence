    "Bedrock, and more specifically its Converse API, has tool calling built-in. As a result, it made sense to overhaul the Bedrock LLM classes to support said tool calling (which involved extra models, handling the output, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the model classes had been rebuilt, the opportunity presented itself to implement a new Agent. Rather than build a vanilla ReAct agent, this one would leverage implicit tool calling, and support some extra features. Let's start off slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "**_Caveat_** Agents work with various models, but they need be 'smart enough'. For instance, NovaPro seems to work quite well, whereas NovaLite of NovaMicro tend to make mistakes in the tool calling, or returning of answers.\n",
